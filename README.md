# cheap-world-of-goo
A cheap impelement of world of goo like game(If you haven't heard of it,I strongly recommend to give it a try.It is a masterpiece)

This program simulates a simple spring system.The most of the work are based on the rendering module I'm working on.

Although it is a direct3d 12 program,I mostly use direct3d 11 style API and seldom add direct3d 12 feature to make the program
simple to build(so why don't I just use direct3d 11).

The program is not well optimized,so too many item in a scene will make the system heavy.Maybe I should improve it's performance some day.

What else should I say?Have fun!
